# Presleyn
The Windows version of Presleyn (aka Peter Zhao: The Game). Credits to Akash S (@Unequip) and Arjun M (@SchoolDucc) for making this game a reality!

Hey there! Presleyn was a school project that the three of us developed in middle school for Computer Science.

In its current state, it contains two acts that are loosely based on the events at Roberto Clemente MS, with a *riveting* storyline and *unmatched* gameplay. *(Not biased.)*

You can play the web version (**NOT RECOMMENDED**) at https://replit.com/@Unequip/Peter-Zhao-The-Game, or download the Windows version and play it on your desktop with zero lag (**objectively better version**).

If you decide to play this, thanks for checking it out and I hope you enjoy!

Acts III-V may *potentially* be in the works... (although they probably won't be released for 4 years. :/)

# Features
- Two action-packed acts based on RCMS with full story & gameplay
- Over 100 unique spells, wands, collectibles, items, and more!
